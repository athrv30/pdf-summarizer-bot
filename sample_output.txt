Summary:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves programming machines to simulate human intelligence, enabling them to think, learn, and act. Common applications include speech recognition, chatbots, and recommendation engines. AI is widely used across industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Machine learning, a crucial component of AI, allows systems to improve with data over time. Despite its benefits, AI faces ethical concerns including bias, lack of transparency, and potential job loss. These issues highlight the importance of responsible AI development and regulation.
