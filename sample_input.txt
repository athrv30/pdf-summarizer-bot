Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These systems are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. AI is used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to learn from data and improve over time. AI-powered tools like speech recognition, recommendation systems, and chatbots are becoming increasingly common. However, ethical concerns such as bias, transparency, and job displacement remain key challenges in AI development.
